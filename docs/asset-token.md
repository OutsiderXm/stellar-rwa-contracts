# Asset Token Contract

A compliant token representing a tokenized real-world asset. Every `transfer`
checks the compliance contract for **both** sender and recipient, and every
`mint` checks the recipient — so only KYC-approved addresses can hold the asset.

## The compliance check (core feature)

`transfer` and `mint` call into the compliance contract via a lightweight
generated client:

```rust
#[contractclient(name = "ComplianceClient")]
pub trait ComplianceInterface {
    fn is_allowed(env: Env, address: Address) -> bool;
}
// inside transfer:
if !ComplianceClient::new(&env, &meta.compliance_contract).is_allowed(&from) {
    // -> SenderNotCompliant (#7)
}
if !ComplianceClient::new(&env, &meta.compliance_contract).is_allowed(&to) {
    // -> RecipientNotCompliant (#8)
}
```

This decouples the two contracts at build time — the token only knows the
compliance *interface*, and the concrete compliance contract address is stored
in metadata and can be swapped with `set_compliance`.

## `AssetMetadata`

| Field                 | Type      | Meaning                              |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `name` / `symbol`     | `String`  | Display name and ticker              |
| `asset_type`          | `String`  | `real_estate`, `invoice`, `commodity`|
| `total_supply`        | `i128`    | Current supply (base units)          |
| `decimals`            | `u32`     | Token decimals                       |
| `admin`               | `Address` | Controls mint/pause/valuation        |
| `compliance_contract` | `Address` | Gate consulted on transfer/mint      |
| `asset_description`   | `String`  | Free-text description                |
| `valuation`           | `i128`    | Asset value in **USD cents**         |
| `paused`              | `bool`    | When true, transfers/mints revert    |

## Functions

- `initialize(admin, name, symbol, asset_type, total_supply, decimals, compliance_contract, asset_description, valuation)` —
  stores metadata and mints `total_supply` to `admin`. The admin must already be
  compliance-approved. Admin auth. Once only.
- `transfer(from, to, amount)` — `from` auth; not paused; both parties compliant;
  `from` has balance; moves tokens.
- `mint(admin, to, amount)` — admin auth; not paused; `to` compliant; increases
  supply.
- `burn(from, amount)` — `from` auth; reduces caller balance and supply.
- `balance(id) -> i128`
- `total_supply() -> i128`
- `pause(admin)` / `unpause(admin)` — admin auth.
- `get_metadata() -> AssetMetadata`
- `update_valuation(admin, new_valuation)` — admin auth.
- `set_compliance(admin, compliance)` — admin auth; repoints the gate.

## Security considerations

- Compliance is enforced **inside** `transfer`/`mint`; it cannot be bypassed by
  calling the token directly.
- Amounts must be strictly positive; zero/negative amounts revert.
- `mint` overflow is checked; supply cannot wrap.
- Only the admin can pause, mint, change valuation, or repoint compliance.

## Failure mode: unreachable compliance contract (issue #305)

`transfer`, `mint`, `mint_batch`, `burn`, and `set_compliance` all call into
`compliance_contract` via the generated `ComplianceClient`. This is a real
cross-contract call, not a local check, so it inherits the failure modes of
any Soroban invocation:

- **No contract deployed at that address** — the host cannot resolve the
  call and **traps**, aborting the entire transaction. No balance, supply, or
  metadata change is applied.
- **The callee traps internally** (e.g. it panics on unexpected input) —
  same result: the trap propagates up, the whole transaction rolls back.
- **The callee returns a value but not `bool`** — this cannot happen without
  bypassing the SDK's type-checked client; if it somehow did, decoding would
  itself trap.

This is the deliberate, and only sane, behavior: the token contract has no
way to distinguish "compliance said no" from "compliance is broken," so it
treats an unreachable or malfunctioning gate as a hard failure rather than
either failing open (allowing the transfer) or silently no-opping. Operators
must ensure `compliance_contract` always points at a live, correctly
implemented contract; `set_compliance` mitigates this somewhat by calling the
new gate before switching to it, but does not protect against the gate later
being removed or bricked.

Proven by test: `test_gate_traps_when_compliance_address_has_no_contract` and
`test_transfer_traps_when_compliance_contract_is_unreachable` in
`contracts/asset-token/src/test.rs`.
